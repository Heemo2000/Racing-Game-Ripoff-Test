It is the prototype of simple racing game with 3 racers on circuit track, 
it is not perfect by any means but I will try my best to improve it with time.

The cars AI is implemented by following components:-
1. Context based Steering(Based on the chapter 'Context steering' of Game AI Pro 360 by Steve Rabin)
2. Hierachial State Machine by Inspa HFSM.


If anyone wants to improve this prototype, they can fork this repository.
